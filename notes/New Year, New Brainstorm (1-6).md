**Key project ideas and next steps:**

- Digital archaeology of online blogging websites
	Identifying cultures/ongoing trends over time as the internet has evolved. What is consistent and what has changed? How have platforms adjusted or remained the same? What platforms did not survive? Looking at livejournal, geocities, tumblr, etc.
	
	Continue with GeoCities project: identifying visual trends and ideas of community with models like PixPlot. 
	
	Fandom archaeology and looking at the history of fan works online.

- Bestiary Project and its many faces
	*This is not a bestiary.* Using AI to generate images based off of the same descriptions found in medieval texts about animals (both real and mythical) and comparing the results to genuine depictions. Can be gamified!
	
	Using the bestiary to interact with the past with a specific angle on cultural ideals of purity, goodness, evil, etc. Animal history layer included with how different animals are good/bad, how those ideals have shaped our cultures, how we interact with nature, etc. Understanding medieval beliefs in a new way. Continue training GPT-2 on entire bestiary text.
	
	Latent space explorer with image generation. Using real images from the bestiary to create a grid and explore the latent space between images, generating all the weird goodness in between, looking at the possibilities of what could have been imagined by medieval minds. 
	
	Looking at different bestiaries and using vibe searches to explore the differences between different texts based on region, era, who made it, who was it for, etc.

**Hunting for data:**

Bestiary sources are not necessarily hard to find, but the issue lies more with finding texts that have available translations and information regarding authorship and the date of publishing. My main source that I've been using so far is the Aberdeen Bestiary, which has its own website with the nearly complete manuscript.

What I like about the way the Aberdeen Bestiary has been digitalized, is that it provides both the original text as well as a translation, and each page has some commentary about the illustrations on the page, any information on materials used (for example if egg whites were used to provide a sheen to the illustration), and information on any damages to the page. Each page can be explored on its own, but the manuscript index is organized by showing what each page spread looked like (grouped by 2s). Link to website: https://www.abdn.ac.uk/bestiary/. 

A quick google search of medieval bestiaries has also brought me to "The Medieval Bestiary" (https://bestiary.ca/), which is an indexed collection of various bestiaries. This is really cool, because it features a digital text library with a fairly detailed catalogue and index so I can essentially search by animal and retrieve various impressions. What is especially neat about this collection, is that it is not only an active database with somewhat regular updates, but it is also using a program that generates web pages based off the static entries, meaning this dataset is built the long-term compatibility and survivability. There is also a "beast index" for cross-referencing how different creatures might be named/identified across various writings (like an ape could be called a Callitrix or Affine depending on what text you're looking at).  Another great feature of the beast index is the connected gallery, where each beast has its own assorted gallery of where it has been featured in different texts with image descriptions and source information (there are 134 images of apes).

I think the second index will be a great jumping off point for sourcing more bestiaries if I want to include a diverse dataset, or proceed with my later idea of using vibe searches to explore the differences in these texts. There is an abundance of data surrounding medieval bestiaries, it feels extremely lucky to find a place that organizes and categorizes it so nicely.
