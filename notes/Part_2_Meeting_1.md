Process:
- More important than the end goal.
- What breaks?
- Meetings as bench-marks, what needs to be accomplished.
What are we going to do?
- does not have to be a group project.
- More than just generative AI.
- Wisper: audio to text AI system.
New ideas
- Fine tune a multi-modal image model. Train it yourself.
- Can also retrain a text model.
- retraining BERT models, can be trained for sentiment analysis, recommendations, language manipulation.
- handwriting transcription.
- AI used to challenge historical understandings: the 4 art styles of Pompei, are they real? Pixplot and other similar things might help.
Our Ideas
- Medieval bestiary using image diffusion/generation and comparing that with the drawings of people who were depicting animals which they had never actually seen. describing an animal to to the image generator the same way it was described to the historical person who depicted it.
- Using digital necromancy to animated the average person from a period for use in interactive GLAM exhibits.
- Soundscapes, exploring how sound and IA can be used to depict or represent something historical.
- Stylometry: determining who might have written documents with dubious authorship based on AI trained using their other works. Perhaps on Lenin's testament. quantifying changes in genre. Categories instead of individuals.
- using AI and geomatics to automatically map certain points of historical importance. National airphoto explorer, UK ariel photography library Cambridge. Buildings, crops, etc. Smaller Nazca line geoglyphs. Identifying lost cities. The Vesuvius challenge, competition to identify the ink on carbonized scrolls, someone was able to find a way to train them. Unread cuneiform tablets.
- Topic model for large datasets to find the material related to research.

How to move foreword:
- keep track of why you are doing something
- Keeping track of process is VERY important.
- Things are going to break, keeping track of paradata is important (major component of course grade).
- Do not need to know how to code, more important to understand and explain what is needed is small portions.
Next step:
- an initial data-source to see the obstacles.
- Identify and end goal and the steps to achieve it.
- Spend time learning specific things needed for the project.
- Next meeting: come with a document that is useful for moving forward and the things mentioned above. an outline of potential steps.
